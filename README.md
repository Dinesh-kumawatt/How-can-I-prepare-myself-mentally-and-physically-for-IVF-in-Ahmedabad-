Preparing for IVF in Ahmedabad involves both mental and physical readiness. Physically, patients should aim for a healthy BMI, balanced diet, adequate sleep, and regular light exercise. All pre-IVF medical screenings should be completed on time. Mentally, it's helpful to educate yourself about each IVF step, join support groups, and consider counseling to manage emotional ups and downs. Open communication with your partner and healthcare team ensures you stay informed and supported throughout the journey. Managing expectations realistically can also ease stress during treatment.
